		title: 'Programming TypeScript: Making Your JavaScript Applications Scale',
		author: 'Boris Cherny',
		year: 2019,
		description: `Any programmer working with a dynamically typed language will tell you how hard it is to scale to more lines of code and more engineers. That’s why Facebook, Google, and Microsoft invented gradual static type layers for their dynamically typed JavaScript and Python code. This practical book shows you how one such type layer, TypeScript, is unique among them: it makes programming fun with its powerful static type system.
If you’re a programmer with intermediate JavaScript experience, author Boris Cherny will teach you how to master the TypeScript language. You’ll understand how TypeScript can help you eliminate bugs in your code and enable you to scale your code across more engineers than you could before.

In this book, you’ll:

Start with the basics: Learn about TypeScript’s different types and type operators, including what they’re for and how they’re used
Explore advanced topics: Understand TypeScript’s sophisticated type system, including how to safely handle errors and build asynchronous programs
Dive in hands-on: Use TypeScript with your favorite frontend and backend frameworks, migrate your existing JavaScript project to TypeScript, and run your TypeScript application in production`,

		title: 'Node.js 8 the Right Way: Practical, Server-Side JavaScript That Scales',
		author: 'Jim Wilson',
		year: 2018,
		description: `Node.js is the platform of choice for creating modern web services. This fast-paced book gets you up to speed on server-side programming with Node.js 8, as you develop real programs that are small, fast, low-profile, and useful. Take JavaScript beyond the browser, explore dynamic language features, and embrace evented programming.Harness the power of the event loop and non-blocking I/O to create highly parallel microservices and applications. This expanded and updated second edition showcases the latest ECMAScript features, current best practices, and modern development techniques.
JavaScript is the backbone of the modern web, powering nearly every web app's user interface. Node.js is JavaScript for the server. This greatly expanded second edition introduces new language features while dramatically increasing coverage of core topics. Each hands-on chapter offers progressively more challenging topics and techniques, broadening your skill set and enabling you to think in Node.js.

Write asynchronous, non-blocking code using Node.js's style and patterns. Cluster and load balance services with Node.js core features and third-party tools. Harness the power of databases such as Elasticsearch and Redis. Work with many protocols, create RESTful web services, TCP socket clients and servers, and more. Test your code's functionality with Mocha, and manage its life cycle with npm. Discover how Node.js pairs a server-side event loop with a JavaScript runtime to produce screaming fast, non-blocking concurrency. Through a series of practical programming domains, use the latest available ECMAScript features and harness key Node.js classes and popular modules. Create rich command-line tools and a web-based UI using modern web development techniques.

Join the smart and diverse community that's rapidly advancing the state of the art in JavaScript development.

Angular 2 Development with Typescript teaches you what you need to start using Angular, while you also learn TypeScript and how to take advantage of its benefits.

Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.

About the Technology

Whether you're building web clients or full-featured SPAs, using the Angular 2 web framework is a liberating experience. Its declarative style makes it easy to define and add features without a lot of manually written boilerplate, and the fully integrated TypeScript language gives you the benefits of a statically typed language within the JavaScript ecosystem. Not to mention that adding Angular 2 and TypeScript to your skill set makes you a hot commodity.

About the Book

Angular 2 Development with Typescript introduces Angular 2 to developers comfortable using AngularJS v1 or other web frameworks. You'll start by exploring how Angular 2 works in an online auction application. Along the way, you'll learn to use TypeScript to write type-aware classes, interfaces, and generics. This is a practical book that covers real-world development concerns like data and views, user interaction with forms, and communicating with servers, as well as testing and deploying your Angular 2 applications.

		title: 'Learning TypeScript: Enhance Your Web Development Skills Using Type-Safe JavaScript',
		author: 'Josh Goldberg',
		year: 2022,
		description: `TypeScript has conquered the world of JavaScript: it's one of the world's fastest growing and most popular languages across developer surveys, widely used in consumer and business companies alike, and frequently credited for helping massive web applications scale. But what is TypeScript? How does it work, why does it work, and how can we use it?
Learning TypeScript takes beginner to intermediate JavaScript programmers from knowing nothing about "types" or a "type system" to full mastery of the fundamentals of TypeScript. It's more than a means to find bugs and typos--it's a useful system for declaring the way our JavaScript should work and helping us stick to it. You'll learn how TypeScript:

interacts with JavaScript
analyzes and understands code
augments your existing development pattern
helps you document your code
works with IDEs to provide refactoring tools
assists local development in refactoring code
helps you develop more quickly with fewer bugs`,

		title: 'Kobzar Hardcover – Illustrated',
		author: 'Taras Shevchenko',
		year: 2013,
		description: `Masterfully fulfilled by Peter Fedynsky, Voice of America journalist and expert on Ukrainian studies, this first ever English translation of the complete Kobzar brings out Ukraine's rich cultural heritage.
As a foundational text, The Kobzar by Taras Shevchenko has played an important role in galvanizing the Ukrainian identity and in the development of Ukraine's written language and Ukrainian literature. The first editions had been censored by the Russian czar, but the book still made an enduring impact on Ukrainian culture. There is no reliable count of how many editions of the book have been published, but an official estimate made in 1976 put the figure in Ukraine at 110 during the Soviet period alone. That figure does not include Kobzars released before and after both in Ukraine and abroad. A multitude of translations of Shevchenko's verse into Slavic, Germanic and Romance languages, as well as Chinese, Japanese, Bengali, and many others attest to his impact on world culture as well. The poet is honored with more than 1250 monuments in Ukraine, and at least 125 worldwide, including such capitals as Washington, Ottawa, Buenos Aires, Warsaw, Moscow and Tashkent.`,
